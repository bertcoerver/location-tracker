# location-tracker

A phone drops one small JSON file per location ping into [`locations/`](locations/), and
[`index.html`](index.html) renders them all on a deck.gl map that updates itself as new pings land.

**Live map:** https://bertcoerver.github.io/location-tracker/

## Runs

Every ping belongs to a run — one subfolder of [`locations/`](locations/) per race:

```
locations/
  test/                 an existing run — /?run=test
  vendee-10k/           add a folder, get a map
```

| URL | Shows |
|---|---|
| `/` | whichever run pinged most recently, and it **keeps following** — a new race takes over the plain link as soon as it starts |
| `/?run=test` | `locations/test/`, pinned; never overridden |
| `/?run=locations/test` | the same thing, so you can paste a path straight from GitHub |

**Adding a run is just making a folder** — no config, no code. The picker lists
whatever subfolders exist, newest first, and hides itself when there's only one.
A run that has pinged within the last hour is marked live, with a `●` in the picker
and a dot beside the title.

A file sitting loose in `locations/` belongs to no run and is never shown. An unknown
or malformed `run` falls back to the newest run rather than erroring.

Each run keeps its own point cache, and **switching runs costs no API requests at all**
— see below.

## Data format

One file per fix, named with the capture time as ISO 8601 with **every colon replaced by `_`**:

```
locations/test/2026-07-28T12_06_01+02_00.json
```

The timestamp lives *only* in the filename — there is no time field in the body:

```json
{"lat":46.57352593732256,"lon":-0.7721662634749413,"btry":49}
```

Only `lat` and `lon` are required. `btry` (battery %), `msg` and `img` are optional and the map
handles files that carry any, all, or none of them. Files are never edited once written.

## How the map stays fresh cheaply

Re-downloading every file on a timer would not scale, so the page only ever fetches what it does
not already have:

1. **One conditional request per poll**, to the Git Trees API:
   `GET /repos/…/git/trees/main:locations?recursive=1`, sent with `If-None-Match`. When nothing has
   changed GitHub answers `304 Not Modified`, so no body is transferred. (A 304 still *counts*
   against the rate limit — measured, despite what the docs say. See "Rate limit" below.)
2. **Build the index** from that one response. Because a ping's capture time is in its *filename*,
   the listing alone says which runs exist, when each last moved, and what's in the one on screen.
   That is why the request count doesn't grow with the number of runs.
3. **Diff against `localStorage`**, which caches each point keyed by filename + blob SHA. Because
   files are immutable, a cached entry is never refetched.
4. **Fetch only the new files** from `raw.githubusercontent.com`, which is not subject to the
   API's 60 requests/hour limit.

Steady state is one cheap request every 240 s plus one ~70-byte fetch per new point. Reloading the
page costs a single `304` and zero data fetches. Polling pauses while the tab is hidden and
resumes on focus, subject to the 30 s floor described under "Rate limit".

Steps 1–2 are the only rate-limited work, and they're independent of which run you're looking at.
So **opening a run costs zero API requests**: the cached index already lists its files, and their
bodies come from the CDN. Switching runs can never rate-limit you.

The trade is response size. A tree listing covers every ping in the repo, not one folder, so a
changed poll transfers roughly 200 bytes per ping ever recorded. At race-day volumes that is tens
of kilobytes; see "Known limit" for where it stops being reasonable.

### Rate limit

Unauthenticated GitHub API access is **60 requests/hour per IP address** — per viewer's IP, not
per repo, so audience size on its own is not the problem. File bodies don't count (they come from
the CDN), and a hidden tab doesn't poll.

A 304 counts the same as a 200, so the poll interval *is* the request rate. At `pollMs` of 240 s
that's **15 requests/hour per open tab**, a quarter of the budget:

| Viewers behind one IP | Requests/hour | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1–4 | 15–60 | fine |
| 5+ | 75+ | throttled until the hour rolls |

Distinct connections are unaffected, so a hundred people on their own phones is fine while five in
one office is not. Four safeguards keep a tab from spending faster than that:

- **`minRefreshMs` (30 s) floors the gap between refreshes**, however they were triggered. `focus`
  and `visibilitychange` both fire when a tab comes forward, so without this a viewer flipping
  between tabs could burn the whole hour in a couple of minutes. Overlapping triggers coalesce into
  the one in-flight request rather than stacking.
- **That interval is persisted**, so it survives a page reload — otherwise mashing the browser
  refresh button reset it every time, which was the cheapest way to get rate limited. It's keyed
  per run, so opening a run you haven't viewed still loads immediately.
- **Hidden tabs don't poll at all.**

Measured cost of one page load, warm cache:

| | API requests |
|---|---|
| Reload within 30 s | **0** — repainted from cache |
| Reload after 30 s | **1** |
| Cold load, empty cache | **1** |
| Switching to a run you've never opened | **0** |

Trading latency for headroom is a one-line change to `pollMs` in [`src/config.js`](src/config.js).
Going further means removing the API from the read path entirely — a GitHub Action that aggregates
each run into one static file, which lifts the viewer ceiling completely but adds several minutes
of delay before a new ping is visible.

### Known limit

A tree response is capped at **100,000 entries / 7 MB**, after which GitHub sets `truncated` and
silently drops the rest — roughly a year of pings at the current 5-minute cadence, and the page
says so in the status panel rather than quietly showing a partial map. Response size will get
uncomfortable well before that.

When it does, add a GitHub Action that appends each ping into a compact `<run>/index.json`; only
`fetchTree()` in [`src/github.js`](src/github.js) needs to change, and it's marked in the source.

## Project structure

```
index.html          markup + all CSS (the colour tokens live here)
src/
  main.js           entry point: wires everything together, owns the poll loop
  config.js         repo coordinates, poll interval — the only file to edit
  route.js          which run the URL pins, if any
  github.js         data layer: the tree request, the run index, the point cache
  points.js         cache -> sorted array, time position, bounding box
  map.js            deck.gl instance, camera, follow-latest behaviour
  layers.js         layer construction + tooltip markup
  colors.js         reads the CSS colour tokens, samples the ramp
  util.js           time parsing, formatting, concurrency pool, storage guard
test/
  *.test.js         run with `npm test`
package.json        scripts only — no dependencies, nothing to install
```

These are **native ES modules** (`import`/`export`), which browsers run directly —
there is no bundler and no build step, so what's in `src/` is exactly what ships.
`index.html` loads one file, `<script type="module" src="src/main.js">`, and the
imports pull in the rest.

The one consequence: modules are subject to CORS, so **opening `index.html` as a
`file://` path won't work** — you need a local server (below). Over `http://` it's fine.

If you later want to `npm install` a third-party package, that's the point at which
you'd add a bundler (Vite is the usual choice) — it isn't worth it before then.

### Where to add things

- New data field from the phone → `github.js` (`fetchPoint`) and `layers.js` (`tooltipHtml`).
- New visual layer → `layers.js`, then include it in `pointLayers`.
- New panel or control → `index.html` for markup/CSS, `ui.js` for behaviour.
- New URL parameter → `route.js`.
- Different repo or poll rate → `config.js` only.

## Running it

No install step. Serve the repo root and open it:

```sh
npm run dev          # or: python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/.

## Tests

```sh
npm test
```

Uses Node's built-in test runner — no dependencies, no `npm install`. The suite
runs offline against a fake GitHub and covers the caching contract that the whole
design rests on: a cold start costs one API request and downloads every file once,
an unchanged poll downloads nothing, one new point upstream downloads exactly one
file, opening a run for the first time costs no API request at all, and loose files
never surface as a run.

## Publishing

One-time setup: **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main` / `/ (root)`**. The empty
`.nojekyll` file stops Pages running the repo through Jekyll.
